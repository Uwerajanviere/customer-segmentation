# ðŸ›’ Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis  

This project performs **Customer Segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** on the famous **Online Retail Dataset (UCI)**.  
Itâ€™s a practical way to identify different customer groups and create targeted marketing strategies.  

---

##  Project Overview  

The project follows these steps:  

1. **Load & Clean Data**  
   - Removed canceled orders.  
   - Dropped missing Customer IDs and Descriptions.  
   - Removed negative quantities and zero prices.  
   - Converted `InvoiceDate` to datetime.  
   - Added `TotalPrice` column (Quantity Ã— UnitPrice).  

2. **Calculate RFM Metrics**  
   - **Recency** â†’ Days since last purchase.  
   - **Frequency** â†’ Number of purchases.  
   - **Monetary** â†’ Total spending.  

3. **Score Customers**  
   - Scored Recency, Frequency, and Monetary on a 1â€“4 scale.  
   - Combined into a single `RFM_Score`.  

4. **Segment Customers**  
   - Segmented into groups like **Champions**, **Loyal Customers**, **At Risk**, **Lost Customers**, etc.  

5. **Visualizations**  
   - Bar chart of customer segments.  
   - Heatmap of average RFM values per segment.  

6. **Marketing Ideas (Step 7)**  
   - Each segment is linked to actionable marketing strategies (see below).

##  Marketing Ideas Based on Segments  

**Champions** â†’ Reward them with loyalty programs, exclusive offers, and early product launches.  

**Loyal Customers** â†’ Encourage referrals, give them early access to sales, and upsell/cross-sell.  

**Potential Loyalist** â†’ Offer discounts for second purchase, nurture them into loyal customers.  

**New Customers** â†’ Welcome them with onboarding emails, small discounts, and product recommendations.  

**At Risk** â†’ Send win-back campaigns, discounts, and reminders about what they loved before.  

**Lost Customers** â†’ Try re-engagement campaigns or surveys to understand why they left.  

**Hibernating** â†’ Send seasonal offers or personalized recommendations to wake them up.  

**Need Attention** â†’ Targeted campaigns to keep them from slipping away.
